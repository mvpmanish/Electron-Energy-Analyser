Serial protocol for James' power supply

To ID the device (to find the correct serial port)

<n><S||G><V><x><x>....<\n>

where:
n is the analyser number which can be 1 or 2
S||G is for SET or GET
V is for voltage

Example:
nSVRE10\n   : Set analyser n's (where n is 1 or 2) residual energy voltage to 10 dac points. That is 10 mV. This then gets scaled by the power supply.
1SVLE1234\n : Set analyser 1's lens voltage to 1234 DAC points. In this case, that is 1234 mV.
ID\n        : Get the unit's ID which will return AN\n
2GVAE       : Get Analyser 2's Voltage on All Elements
